In this transcript, the speaker is explaining asynchronous JavaScript programming and the concept of callback functions. Here are the key terms and ideas:

1. **Callbacks**: In JavaScript, a callback is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function. 

2. **Asynchronous Code**: This is code that is designed to perform a task and then move on without waiting for the task to complete. The task (typically I/O operations) runs in the background, and a callback function is called when the task is done.

3. **Synchronous Code**: This is the opposite of asynchronous code. Each operation must complete before the next one starts.

4. **setTimeout**: This is a JavaScript function that calls a function or evaluates an expression after a specified number of milliseconds.

5. **AJAX Calls**: AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications. 

6. **Web APIs**: These are application programming interfaces (APIs) developed to be used via HTTP to extend functionalities of a web server. 

7. **getJSON**: This is a method in jQuery used to fetch JSON data from a server using an AJAX HTTP GET request.

8. **Promise**: Although not directly mentioned in this part of the transcript, a promise in JavaScript represents a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved or rejected at some point in the future. It's used to handle asynchronous operations, providing a more powerful and flexible mechanism than callbacks.

To demonstrate the concepts:

Here is an example of synchronous code:
```javascript
console.log('First');
console.log('Second');
console.log('Third');
```
This will always output:
```
First
Second
Third
```
Now, consider an asynchronous example:
```javascript
console.log('First');
setTimeout(() => console.log('Second'), 0);
console.log('Third');
```
This might seem like it should output the same thing as the synchronous example, but it actually outputs:
```
First
Third
Second
```
This is because `setTimeout` is asynchronous. Even with a delay of `0`, it schedules a new task to be performed once the current execution thread is over, hence allowing `console.log('Third');` to execute before the callback inside `setTimeout`.

When it comes to AJAX, imagine we're fetching data from a server:
```javascript
$.getJSON('https://api.example.com/data', function(data) {
    console.log(data);
});
console.log('After AJAX request');
```
In this case, "After AJAX request" will likely print before the data, because the request is asynchronous and JavaScript will continue executing the next lines without waiting for the request to complete.
