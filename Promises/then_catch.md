In this transcript, the speaker is discussing some important concepts related to JavaScript and the use of promises. Let's review the major points:

1. **Promise**: In JavaScript, a Promise is an object that represents a value which may not be available yet but will be available in the future, or it will never be available (in case of an error). They have three states:
   - *Pending*: The Promise's outcome hasn't yet been determined, because the asynchronous operation that will produce its result hasn't completed yet.
   - *Fulfilled (Resolved)*: The asynchronous operation has completed, and the Promise has a resulting value.
   - *Rejected*: The asynchronous operation failed, and the Promise will never be fulfilled. In the rejected state, a Promise has a reason that indicates why the operation failed.

2. **Axios**: Axios is a popular, promise-based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. It can make XMLHttpRequests from the browser, has a wide range of features, and it returns promises. 

3. **then() and catch()**: These are two methods that every JavaScript Promise comes with. The then() method is used with a Promise to specify what should happen when the Promise is fulfilled, or resolved. The catch() method is used to specify what should happen if the Promise is rejected. 

4. **Callbacks**: A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after its parent function has completed. In the context of Promises, the then() and catch() methods both accept callback functions that are executed when the Promise is resolved or rejected, respectively.

5. **Promise Chaining**: The speaker mentions this concept but doesn't explain it in the transcript. Promise chaining is a technique where the return value of the first resolve handler will be passed as an argument to the second resolve handler and so on. This allows you to perform a series of asynchronous operations one after the other.

Here's a simple example to demonstrate these concepts:

```javascript
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const result = true;
    
    // Simulating async operation with setTimeout
    setTimeout(() => {
        if (result) {
            resolve('Promise is resolved');
        } else {
            reject('Promise is rejected');
        }
    }, 2000);
});

promise
    .then(value => {
        console.log(value); // 'Promise is resolved'
        return value + ' - We can chain promises';
    })
    .then(newValue => {
        console.log(newValue); // 'Promise is resolved - We can chain promises'
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.log(error);
    });
```
In this example, we create a new Promise that simulates an asynchronous operation using setTimeout. After 2 seconds, if the "result" is true, the Promise is resolved; otherwise, it's rejected. Then we use then() to log the resolved value and chain another then() to further manipulate and log the value. If the Promise were rejected, the catch() method would handle the error and log the error message.
