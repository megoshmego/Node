This transcript discusses a few key concepts and tools in web development, specifically JavaScript, HTTP requests, and the Axios library:

1. **HTTP Requests**: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext requests from a client to a server on the internet. HTTP requests can take various forms, such as GET (retrieve data), POST (send data), DELETE (remove data), etc.

2. **Promises**: Promises in JavaScript are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises are in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

3. **Axios**: Axios is a popular, promise-based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. It can be used to make XMLHttpRequests from the browser, and it supports the Promise API natively. 

4. **XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object**: This is an API in the form of an object, and it is used to interact with servers. It provides an easy way to retrieve data from a URL without having to perform a full page refresh. This makes it possible to update parts of a web page without disrupting what the user is doing.

5. **Fetch API**: This is a modern, promise-based alternative to the older, callback-based XHR. It's more powerful and flexible, but also slightly more complex.

6. **Star Wars API**: The speaker uses the Star Wars API to demonstrate making HTTP requests. This is a publicly available API that provides data from the Star Wars franchise.

7. **AJAX**: AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. It's a set of web technologies used to send and receive data from a client to a server asynchronously, allowing web pages to update dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.

8. **HTTP status codes**: These are standard response codes given by web site servers on the internet. The codes help identify the cause of the problem when a web page or other resource does not load properly.

Here's a brief demonstration of the core concepts using a simple example:

```javascript
// Import the `axios` library
const axios = require('axios');

// Make a GET request to a public API
axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/people/1/')
  .then(function (response) {
    // Handle the response data in the promise's `then` method
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    // Handle any errors in the promise's `catch` method
    console.log(error);
  });
```

In this example, we use the `axios` library to make a GET request to the Star Wars API. We then handle the response in the promise's `then` method and print the response data to the console. If there's an error with the request, it will be caught in the `catch` method and the error will be printed to the console.
