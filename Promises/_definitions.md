Certainly, here are the terms and their definitions:

1. **Promise**: In JavaScript, a Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Essentially, it's a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

2. **Resolve**: The term 'resolve' is used when the Promise's operation completes successfully. This is one of the final states of a Promise.

3. **Reject**: 'Reject' is used when the Promise's operation fails. This is another one of the final states of a Promise.

4. **mockAjaxRequest**: This is a function that simulates an Ajax request, which is a Promise that either resolves or rejects based on a random condition. It is typically used in tests or as an example in teaching scenarios.

5. **Asynchronous Code**: This is code that is designed to perform a task and then move on without waiting for the task to complete. This allows for other tasks to run in the meantime, improving performance in situations where the task would otherwise take a lot of time to complete.

6. **Synchronous Code**: This refers to code that performs tasks one at a time, waiting for each operation to complete before moving on to the next one.

7. **setTimeout**: This is a built-in JavaScript function that calls a function or evaluates an expression after a specified number of milliseconds. It's often used to simulate time-consuming operations.

8. **AJAX Calls**: AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It's a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications.

9. **Web APIs**: Web APIs are interfaces in web development that are used to manipulate the structure and style of documents in the web, handle events, create animations, send HTTP requests to servers, fetch resources, etc.

10. **getJSON**: This is a method in jQuery, a JavaScript library, that is used to fetch JSON data from a server using an AJAX HTTP GET request.

11. **Variable Declaration in JavaScript**: JavaScript uses `var`, `let`, and `const` to declare variables. `var` is function scoped, while `let` and `const` are block scoped. `const` is used to declare constants in JavaScript.

12. **Function Declaration in JavaScript**: Functions in JavaScript are declared using the `function` keyword. They can also be defined as an expression.

13. **Syntax Differences**: JavaScript uses curly braces `{}` to define blocks of code and does not require semicolons `;` at the end of every line, unlike some other languages.

14. **Async Functions**: Async functions are a way to write asynchronous code in JavaScript. They are essentially a cleaner way to work with asynchronous code, using the `async` and `await` keywords.

15. **Ajax Requests with Axios**: Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. It's often used to make AJAX requests by sending HTTP requests to servers.

16. **Promise API**: The Promise API in JavaScript provides a way to handle asynchronous operations. It includes methods like `Promise.resolve()`, `Promise.reject()`, `Promise.all()`, and `Promise.race()`.

17. **Asynchronous Callback Pattern**: This is a pattern in JavaScript where a function (a callback) is passed as a parameter to another function to be executed once an asynchronous operation has completed.

18. **Chain of Promises**: When you have a series of asynchronous tasks that need to be performed one after another, you can chain them together using `.then()`. Each `.then()` returns a new promise, which can be continually chained.

19. **Promise Factory**: This refers to a function that generates a Promise. It's a way to create promises that are not immediately invoked
