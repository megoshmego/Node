Important Terms and Ideas:
1. **JavaScript**: A high-level, interpreted programming language that is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
2. **Python**: Another high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes code readability and supports multiple programming paradigms.
3. **Variable Declaration in JavaScript**: In JavaScript, the `let` and `const` keywords are used to define a variable.
4. **Function Declaration in JavaScript**: Functions in JavaScript are declared using the `function` keyword, as opposed to `def` in Python.
5. **Syntax Differences**: JavaScript uses curly braces `{}` for scope and doesn't have a strict indentation rule like Python.
6. **Async Functions**: A modern way to write asynchronous code in JavaScript. They are essentially a cleaner way to work with asynchronous code, using the `async` and `await` keywords.
7. **Ajax Requests with Axios**: Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, often used for making asynchronous HTTP requests.
8. **Promises**: In JavaScript, a Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It serves as a link between the asynchronous computation (which could be ongoing or already done) and the resulting value or error.
9. **Promise API**: JavaScript's Promise API provides various methods to handle the resolution or rejection of promises. Examples include `Promise.resolve()`, `Promise.reject()`, `Promise.all()`, `Promise.race()`, etc.
10. **Asynchronous Callback Pattern**: A pattern in JavaScript where a function is passed as a parameter to another function to be executed once an asynchronous operation has completed.

Concept Demonstrations:

1. **Variable Declaration in JavaScript**:
    ```javascript
    let variable1 = "Hello";
    const variable2 = "World";
    ```

2. **Function Declaration in JavaScript**:
    ```javascript
    function greet() {
        console.log("Hello, World!");
    }
    ```

3. **Async Functions & Await**:
    ```javascript
    async function fetchData() {
        let response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        let data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
    }
    fetchData();
    ```
   
4. **Promise Creation and Usage**:
    ```javascript
    let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        let condition = true; // Represents some condition
        if (condition) {
            resolve("Promise resolved");
        } else {
            reject("Promise rejected");
        }
    });

    promise
    .then((message) => {
        console.log(message); // Will print "Promise resolved"
    })
    .catch((message) => {
        console.error(message);
    });
    ```

5. **Promise API Usage**:
    ```javascript
    Promise.all([Promise.resolve(true), Promise.resolve('Hello')])
    .then((values) => console.log(values)) // Will print [true, 'Hello']
    .catch((error) => console.error(error));
    ```

6. **Asynchronous Callback Pattern**:
    ```javascript
    function asyncFunction(callback) {
        setTimeout(() => {
            callback("Hello after 2 seconds");
        }, 2000);
    }

    asyncFunction((message) => {
        console.log(message);
    });
    ```
