This transcript discusses the use of Promises in JavaScript, with a specific focus on callback nesting and promise chaining in asynchronous operations. The presenter uses the Star Wars API (SWAPI) and the JavaScript library Axios to illustrate these concepts.

Here's a breakdown of the significant terms and concepts:

1. **Promises**: Objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. They help to manage asynchronous operations, allowing developers to write cleaner and more maintainable code.

2. **Callbacks**: Functions that are passed into another function to be executed later. They're commonly used in asynchronous operations.

3. **Callback Nesting (Callback Hell)**: Refers to the situation where callbacks are nested within callbacks, leading to code that's difficult to read and debug. It's a problem that Promises help to address.

4. **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It's used to make HTTP requests.

5. **Promise Chaining**: The process of executing promises sequentially. When a promise resolves, it can return another promise, allowing them to be chained together. Promise chaining helps to avoid callback nesting.

6. **.then()**: A method of a Promise that's used to schedule callbacks to be called when the Promise is fulfilled or rejected.

7. **.catch()**: A method of a Promise that's used to handle any exceptions that are thrown in a Promise chain. 

Here's a simple demonstration of the concepts using JavaScript:

```javascript
// Creating a new Promise
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // some asynchronous operation
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Promise resolved"), 1000); 
});

// Using .then() to schedule a callback
promise.then((message) => {
    console.log(message); // "Promise resolved"
}).catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
});

// Chaining Promises
let promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("First Promise resolved"), 1000);
});

let promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Second Promise resolved"), 2000);
});

promise1.then((message1) => {
    console.log(message1); // "First Promise resolved"
    return promise2;
}).then((message2) => {
    console.log(message2); // "Second Promise resolved"
}).catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
});
```
In this example, the first promise is resolved after 1 second and then the second promise is resolved after 2 seconds. The `.catch()` will handle any error that occurs in the chain.
