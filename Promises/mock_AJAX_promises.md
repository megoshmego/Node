The transcript is about the concept of JavaScript Promises, a construct used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. Here are the key terms and ideas:

1. **Promise:** A Promise is an object in JavaScript that is used to handle asynchronous operations. It represents an operation that hasn't completed yet but is expected in the future.

2. **Mock AJAX Request:** The instructor creates a mock AJAX request using a Promise. This is a simulation of a real AJAX request, which is a technique for accessing web servers from a web page.

3. **Resolve and Reject:** When a Promise is successful, it is "resolved", and when it fails, it is "rejected". These are the two possible states for the completion of a Promise.

4. **.then() and .catch() methods:** These are used to handle the resolution and rejection of Promises, respectively. `.then()` is executed when the Promise is resolved and `.catch()` is used when the Promise is rejected.

5. **Callback Function:** A function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function. In the context of Promises, callback functions are often passed to `.then()` and `.catch()` methods.

6. **Chain of Promises:** The instructor demonstrates chaining of Promises by returning another Promise in the `.then()` method. This allows for sequential execution of asynchronous operations.

7. **Promise Factory:** The instructor eventually refactors the hard-coded Promise into a function that generates a new Promise each time it's called. This is referred to as a Promise factory.

Here is a simple demonstration of these concepts:

```javascript
// This is a function which returns a new Promise - a Promise Factory
function mockAjaxRequest() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            const random = Math.random();
            if(random < 0.5) {
                resolve('Here is your data');
            } else {
                reject('Sorry, your request failed');
            }
        }, 1000);
    });
}

// Here we are using the Promise
mockAjaxRequest()
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
        return mockAjaxRequest();
    })
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.log(error);
    });
```

In this demonstration, `mockAjaxRequest` is a Promise factory that simulates an AJAX request. After 1 second (`setTimeout` is used to simulate network delay), it either resolves or rejects based on a random number. The Promise is then used, and another Promise is chained to it. If any Promise in the chain is rejected, the `.catch()` method handles the error.
