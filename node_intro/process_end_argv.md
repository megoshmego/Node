Important terms and ideas from the transcript:

1. Process: In Node.js, the `process` object is a global object that provides information and control over the current Node.js process. It allows access to environment variables, command-line arguments, and other process-related functionalities.

2. Environment variables: Environment variables are variables that are part of the operating system's environment and can be accessed by processes running on that system. They are key-value pairs used to configure and pass information to applications. In Node.js, environment variables can be accessed using `process.env`.

3. `process.env`: It is an object in Node.js that provides access to environment variables. It allows developers to access environment variables and their values within a Node.js script.

4. `process.argv`: It is an array in Node.js that stores the command-line arguments passed when executing a Node.js script. The first element (`process.argv[0]`) contains the path to the Node.js executable, and the second element (`process.argv[1]`) contains the path to the script being executed. Additional command-line arguments are stored in subsequent elements of the `process.argv` array.

Demonstration:

To demonstrate the concepts mentioned in the transcript, let's create a simple Node.js script that utilizes the `process.env` and `process.argv` objects. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new file called `envArgs.js`.

2. In `envArgs.js`, write the following code:

```javascript
// Accessing environment variables
console.log(process.env.COLOR); // Access the value of the "COLOR" environment variable
console.log(process.env.SECRET); // Access the value of the "SECRET" environment variable

// Accessing command-line arguments
process.argv.forEach((arg, index) => {
  console.log(`Argument ${index}: ${arg}`);
});
```

3. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `envArgs.js`.

4. Set environment variables by running the following commands:

   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```
     export COLOR=pink
     export SECRET="I like purple"
     ```

   - For Windows (PowerShell):
     ```
     $env:COLOR = "pink"
     $env:SECRET = "I like purple"
     ```

5. Run the command `node envArgs.js` to execute the script.

The script will access the environment variables `COLOR` and `SECRET` using `process.env` and display their values. It will also loop through the command-line arguments passed and print each argument along with its index.

By following these steps, you can observe how to access environment variables and command-line arguments using `process.env` and `process.argv` respectively in a Node.js script. Remember to adapt the steps based on your specific environment variable names and command-line arguments.
