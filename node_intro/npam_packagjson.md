Important terms and ideas:
1. npm (Node Package Manager): It is a tool used to fetch or install dependencies for a Node application. It manages packages and libraries in the Node ecosystem.
2. Node: Refers to the Node.js runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
3. Dependencies: The packages or libraries required by a Node application to function properly.
4. Package.json: A file that specifies the dependencies and other metadata of a Node project. It is equivalent to the requirements.txt file in Python.
5. node_modules: A directory where the installed packages and their dependencies are stored.
6. npm init: A command used to initialize a new Node project and create a package.json file.
7. npm install: A command used to install packages and their dependencies.
8. package-lock.json: A file that stores detailed information about the installed packages and their versions.

Simple Demonstration:

To demonstrate the concepts, let's create a basic Node project and install a package using npm.

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Create a new directory for the project: `mkdir my-node-project`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd my-node-project`
4. Initialize the project and create a package.json file: `npm init -y` (The `-y` flag skips the questionnaire and uses default values.)
5. Install a package (e.g., "lodash"): `npm install lodash`
6. Check the package.json file to see the installed package: `cat package.json`
7. You will find a "dependencies" section that lists "lodash" with its version.
8. Explore the "node_modules" directory to find the installed package: `ls node_modules`

That's it! You have successfully initialized a Node project, created a package.json file, and installed a package using npm.
