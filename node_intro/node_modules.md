can you please evaluate the following transcript for important terms, ideas , and give a simple demonstration of the concepts for review? 

0:06
we share code between files.
0:08
It's really common that we'll want to break up a large app,
0:11
into smaller files that are just easier to work with,
0:14
and where things are separated out.
0:16
Just like we did in Python, we had models files,
0:19
and forms files.
0:20
When we used other forms, we had our own app dot .PY file,
0:23
we could have a route file.
0:25
They're all Python files and we are importing them,
0:28
whenever necessary, so that we can use that code.
0:31
In Node, things are kind of similar,
0:34
but also kind of different.
0:35
So in order to share files,
0:37
the terminology in Node is that we are writing modules,
0:40
and importing or using modules,
0:43
which is just something to find in another file.
0:46
However, unlike regular JavaScript, I shouldn't say regular,
0:49
unlike client side, JavaScript,
0:51
we don't have access to script tags or anything like that.
0:55
So we have to manually import and export.
0:57
If you think about client side JS,
0:59
we have a single HTML file.
1:01
We could import 10 scripts,
1:03
as long as they're in the correct order.
1:05
I'll have access to jQuery in any of my other scripts,
1:09
or Axios, if I import Axios and jQuery first.
1:12
In Node, it works differently.
1:14
We need to manually import things whenever they're needed.
1:18
And just a quick note,
1:19
this system that I'm referring to,
1:21
you might come across the term CommonJS Modules,
1:25
later on we'll see another way of sharing code,
1:27
across files using Node, but for now, we're focusing
1:30
on CommonJS modules.
1:32
So to import something, we use that same require keyword
1:35
we saw earlier, when we were importing a library,
1:38
like Axios.
1:39
But it's slightly different.
1:40
We need to specify a relative path to a file.
1:44
So require and then ./, or../,
1:48
or./helpers/usefulStuff.
1:52
It doesn't matter what the actual file is,
1:54
but we need to specify the correct path to get to that file.
1:58
And if we're importing a JavaScript file,
2:00
we don't need to write the .JS extension.
2:03
So let's do a simple example here.
2:05
I have a file called helpers.JS.
2:07
Let's just define a simple helper, called add.
2:11
So add, we'll take X and Y, and it returns X + Y.
2:17
Okay. So there's my function, add.
2:20
Now, if I make a new file in the same folder,
2:23
I'll call this app.JS.
2:26
Inside of app JS.
2:28
If I want to import helpers, I can do, require,
2:32
and then the relative path is ./helpers,
2:36
and I don't have to add .JS.
2:39
And then I need to save that to some variable.
2:41
We'll call this, helpers.
2:44
Unfortunately, this won't quite do what I want.
2:48
This is the first step, but if I try and run this.
2:52
And why don't I do this from Node, actually?
2:54
I'll go over here and just open up Node.
2:56
I'll go into the new directory I created called, modules.
2:59
I have my app JS and my helpers JS.
3:02
Let's just open up Node like this,
3:03
and then do,
3:04
const helpers = require./helpers.
3:12
And if we look at helpers, we didn't get an error,
3:16
but it's just an empty object.
3:19
Let's see what happens if I try
3:19
and import something that doesn't exist.
3:22
And instead of naming it, helpers,
3:24
I'll go with, does not exist, DNE.
3:28
Okay? So we get a different error.
3:30
If I try and require something that just doesn't exist,
3:33
it tells us straight up, cannot find that module.
3:36
Here, this file does exist. It did find it,
3:39
but why is the module empty?
3:42
The object that I get here, called helpers,
3:44
just gave it that name, is empty. Why?
3:47
Well, unlike Python, it's a two-step process.
3:50
In order to use code from another file.
3:53
Yes, we need to import it or require it.
3:55
But in that other file,
3:57
we have to manually specify what we are exporting.
4:00
What is available to use in other files?
4:03
And that looks like this, right here.
4:05
There is a special property called module.exports,
4:09
that we can set in any Node file.
4:12
And we set it to be whatever we want,
4:14
but often we'll make it an object like this.
4:17
And in this object,
4:18
we will put things like add, and we'll have access
4:21
to add, whenever we import this module.
4:25
So we can do that now,
4:27
module, in my helpers JS,
4:30
module.exports =,
4:33
and then I can just set, add to be add,
4:36
or I could give this a different name,
4:38
or I could define add right here, in line.
4:42
But I'll go with, add is add.
4:43
And then I'll also define a second function.
4:46
We'll call this subtract, X and Y, we'll return X - Y,
4:51
but I'm not going to add that to module.exports.
4:55
Okay?
4:56
So now, I'll go back here.
4:58
I will exit Node. I'll open it up again.
5:01
Run that same line to require helpers.
5:04
Now, if we look at helpers, helpers,
5:08
we have an object that contains add,
5:11
it does not contain subtract, it just has add.
5:14
Even though helpers.JS,
5:16
the file, has a function called subtract.
5:18
We didn't export it.
5:21
So we have to specify what we want to be exportable.
5:25
So module.exports allows us to be very explicit about
5:29
what we want other files to be able to import.
5:32
And I could call add very easily, helpers.add,
5:35
and we'll do one and four.
5:37
And there we go, we get five.
5:40
So whenever I require something like this helpers file,
5:43
this variable I'm defining, will be equal
5:46
to whatever module.exports is.
5:49
In this case, it's an object.
5:51
If I instead just decided to go crazy and say,
5:54
module.exports
5:57
= 77,
6:00
and then I tried this again, .exits, open up Node,
6:05
and I import helpers.
6:07
If I look at helpers,
6:08
it's just the number 77.
6:11
So module.exports is really simple.
6:13
Sometimes I see students get intimidated.
6:16
They think that it's kind of confusing.
6:17
It's just a special property we set,
6:20
and whatever you set it equal to,
6:22
is what you'll be able to import in another file.
6:25
So, if I wanted to export both add and subtract,
6:29
I'll just do that here, subtract, subtract,
6:34
I could also export color,
6:37
which will be PURPLE in all caps, just like that.
6:41
And now in my app.JS,
6:43
I can import using, require, the helpers file.
6:47
And then I can call things like helpers.color,
6:52
and why don't I print that out?
6:53
Console.log, helpers.color.
6:56
And then we'll also do helpers.subtract,
7:00
subtract five, two.
7:03
Now, I'll execute app.JS.
7:06
So I'll get out of my Node shell here,
7:09
node.app.JS.
7:11
We get purple and three,
7:14
because we subtracted five minus two.
7:17
And it's also very common to structure when you import,
7:21
if we are exporting an object with different methods,
7:24
different properties,
7:25
if we don't want to have to type helpers.color,
7:29
helpers.subtract, I could de-structure this helpers object,
7:33
the module.exports object,
7:35
although it does need to be an object.
7:37
So if you were exporting the number 77, this won't work.
7:41
But conventionally, we do export an object.
7:44
So I'll just duplicate this line, and rewrite it,
7:48
to just extract.
7:49
Let's say, add and subtract, and color.
7:53
And now I can print out color,
7:55
I can subtract,
7:57
and I'll add, without having to reference helpers.
8:01
How about we add 22 and 45?
8:05
I run the code, PURPLE, three, 67.
8:10
So that's really the basics for importing and exporting,
8:13
we can require from different directories,
8:16
not just the same folder.
8:17
We could do ./stuff/helpers,
8:21
and that would look for a file called helpers.JS
8:24
in a stuff directory,
8:26
that is nested inside the current directory.
8:29
When we do not use a relative path,
8:31
if I just tried to require helpers, without that ./,
8:35
we've already seen what this does.
8:37
It will look in Node modules, cannot find module, helpers.
8:40
It's trying to look inside of Node modules,
8:43
and it can't find it.
8:44
So we need that ./.
8:47
That tells it,
8:48
"Okay, this is not a Node module that we downloaded.
8:50
This is a local module.
8:52
It's in this exact folder here, ./helpers,
8:56
or one folder up../helpers."
8:59
So we import using require and unlike Python,
9:03
we have to manually export.
9:05
We don't have access to add and subtract,
9:07
unless we set module.exports to contain, add,
9:10
and subtract.
9:11
