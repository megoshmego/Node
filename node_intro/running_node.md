The transcript discusses the usage of Node.js, including running Node in the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) and executing JavaScript files with Node. It also mentions the importance of understanding how to execute files with Node and introduces the concept of npm (Node Package Manager) for downloading and using libraries and modules in Node.

Here's a simple demonstration of the concepts discussed:

1. Running Node in the REPL:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Type `node` and hit Enter to open the Node REPL.
   - Type JavaScript code, such as `1 + 1`, and press Enter to see the result (`2`).
   - You can use other JavaScript syntax, like defining variables, arrays, and executing functions in the Node REPL.

2. Executing a JavaScript file with Node:
   - Open a text editor and create a new file with a `.js` extension, e.g., `script.js`.
   - Add JavaScript code to the file, such as `console.log("Hello from Node");`.
   - Save the file.
   - In the terminal, navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
   - Type `node script.js` and hit Enter to execute the JavaScript file with Node.
   - The output, `"Hello from Node"`, will be displayed in the terminal.

These demonstrations illustrate the basic usage of Node.js in both the REPL and by executing JavaScript files with Node.
