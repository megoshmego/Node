The transcript discusses the concept of making asynchronous requests in parallel instead of sequentially. It introduces the idea of avoiding unnecessary waiting for requests to finish before sending the next one. Two approaches are presented: awaiting multiple requests using `axios.get` and using `Promise.all` to send requests in parallel.

Here's a breakdown of the important terms and ideas:

1. Sequential requests: The initial approach involves making requests one after another, awaiting each request's response before sending the next request. This can lead to slower overall execution, especially when dealing with multiple independent requests.

2. Parallel requests: To improve efficiency, requests can be sent in parallel, allowing them to be processed simultaneously. By sending all requests first and then awaiting their responses, the overall execution time can be significantly reduced.

3. `Promise.all`: One way to send requests in parallel is by using `Promise.all`. It accepts an array of promises and returns a new promise that resolves when all the promises in the array have resolved. This approach eliminates the need for individual variable assignments for each request and simplifies the code.

Here's a simplified demonstration of making parallel requests using `Promise.all`:

```javascript
async function catchSomeOfEmParallel() {
  const requests = [
    axios.get('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1'),
    axios.get('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/2'),
    axios.get('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/3'),
  ];

  const responses = await Promise.all(requests);

  responses.forEach((response, index) => {
    console.log(`Response ${index + 1}:`, response.data);
  });
}

catchSomeOfEmParallel();
```

In this example, `axios.get` requests are stored in an array called `requests`. The `Promise.all` function is used to create a master promise that awaits all the requests in parallel. When the master promise is resolved, an array of responses is obtained.

The `responses.forEach` loop iterates over the responses and logs the data for each request. The requests are sent in parallel, and the responses are received and processed simultaneously.

By making parallel requests, the overall execution time can be reduced, especially when dealing with multiple independent requests.
