1. **Node.js**: An open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

2. **Node Package Manager (npm)**: The default package manager for Node.js. It allows developers to install, share, and package modules.

3. **Server-side JavaScript**: Node.js enables developers to write JavaScript code that runs on the server-side, allowing them to build web applications and perform server-side tasks using JavaScript.

4. **Modules**: In Node.js, modules are JavaScript files that can be imported into other JavaScript files. They provide a way to organize and reuse code.

5. **CommonJS Modules**: A module system used in Node.js for sharing code across files. It requires manual importing and exporting.

6. **require**: The `require` keyword is used to import modules in Node.js.

7. **module.exports**: In Node.js, the `module.exports` property is used to specify what can be imported from a module in other files.

8. **Async methods**: These are functions in JavaScript that return a Promise. They allow JavaScript to perform asynchronous operations, executing tasks outside the regular synchronous execution flow.

9. **Promise**: A Promise in JavaScript represents a value that may not be available yet but will be available at some point, or it might never be available. 

10. **Axios**: Axios is a popular, promise-based HTTP client that can be used in both the browser and Node.js. It's often used to send HTTP requests.

11. **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

12. **Environment variables**: These are dynamic values loaded into the application's environment. In Node.js, environment variables can be accessed using `process.env`.

13. **Middleware**: Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle in Express.js.

14. **RESTful APIs**: A set of rules/constraints used to build web services. Node.js is often used to build RESTful APIs due to its efficient handling of I/O operations.

15. **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

16. **Console.log**: This is a function in JavaScript which is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user.
