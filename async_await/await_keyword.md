The transcript introduces the concepts of async and await in JavaScript, which are used to write asynchronous code that appears synchronous. Here is a simple demonstration of the concepts:

In JavaScript, the `async` keyword is used to declare a function as asynchronous, and the `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of an async function until a promise is resolved. Here's an example:

```javascript
async function getStarWarsData() {
  console.log("STARTING!");
  const response = await axios.get("https://swapi.dev/api/films");
  console.log("ENDING!");
  console.log(response.data);
}

getStarWarsData();
```

In this example, the `getStarWarsData` function is declared as asynchronous using the `async` keyword. Inside the function, we use `await` to pause the execution until the promise returned by `axios.get` is resolved. The resolved value is stored in the `response` variable. The code after the `await` line is executed only after the promise is resolved.

When you run the `getStarWarsData()` function, it first logs "STARTING!" to the console, then it pauses at the `await` line until the API request is complete. After that, it logs "ENDING!" and prints the data from the response.

The combination of `async` and `await` simplifies the code and makes it easier to follow the logical order of execution, even though it is based on promises behind the scenes.
