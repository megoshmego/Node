The transcript discusses the concepts of `async` functions and the `await` keyword in JavaScript. Here's a breakdown of the important terms and ideas:

1. `async` keyword: When a function is declared with the `async` keyword, it becomes an asynchronous function. It allows the function to return a promise, even if the return value is not explicitly wrapped in a promise.

2. Promise return: An async function always returns a promise, whether it's a resolved promise (when a value is returned) or a rejected promise (when an error is thrown inside the function).

3. Resolved promise: An async function automatically wraps the return value in a resolved promise. This means that the resolved value can be accessed through the promise's `.then()` callback.

4. Rejected promise: To reject a promise generated by an async function, an error can be thrown inside the function. This will cause the generated promise to be rejected, and the rejection can be handled using the promise's `.catch()` callback.

5. `await` keyword: The `await` keyword can only be used inside an async function. It is used to pause the execution of the async function until the promise being awaited is resolved. The `await` expression returns the resolved value of the promise.

Here's a simplified demonstration based on the transcript:

```javascript
async function sayHi() {
  return 'Hello';
}

async function oops() {
  throw 'Bad idea';
}

sayHi().then(message => {
  console.log('Inside then:', message);
});

oops()
  .then(message => {
    console.log('Inside then:', message);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log('Inside catch:', error);
  });
```

In this example, the `sayHi` function is an async function that simply returns the string "Hello". When we call `sayHi()`, it returns a promise that resolves with the string "Hello". We can access the resolved value using the `.then()` callback.

The `oops` function is also an async function, but instead of returning a value, it throws an error with the message "Bad idea". When we call `oops()`, it returns a rejected promise with the error message. We can handle the rejection using the `.catch()` callback.

When you run this code, it will print "Inside then: Hello" for the `sayHi()` function since the promise is resolved. For the `oops()` function, it will print "Inside catch: Bad idea" since the promise is rejected.

Async functions and the `await` keyword simplify asynchronous programming by allowing code to look synchronous, even though it's executing asynchronously. This makes it easier to manage asynchronous operations and handle their results.
