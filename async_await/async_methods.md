The transcript discusses adding asynchronous instance methods to classes in JavaScript. Here is a simple demonstration of the concepts:

In JavaScript, you can add instance methods to classes that are asynchronous by using the `async` keyword in front of the method name. For example:
```javascript
class Pokemon {
  constructor(id) {
    this.id = id;
  }

  async getInfo() {
    const response = await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${this.id}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
    // Extract desired information and assign it to class properties
    this.name = data.name;
    this.types = data.types.map(type => type.type.name);
  }
}
```
In this example, the `Pokemon` class has an asynchronous instance method `getInfo()`. Inside the method, an API request is made to retrieve information about a specific Pokémon using the provided ID. The `await` keyword is used to wait for the API response and the subsequent conversion to JSON. The data is then logged and the desired information (name and types) is extracted and assigned to class properties (`this.name` and `this.types`).

To demonstrate the usage, you can create an instance of the `Pokemon` class and call the `getInfo()` method. Here's an example:
```javascript
const p = new Pokemon(45);
p.getInfo();
```
In this case, a new `Pokemon` instance is created with an ID of 45, and then the `getInfo()` method is called. The method retrieves the information for the Pokémon with ID 45 and assigns the relevant data to the instance's properties.

You can create multiple instances of the `Pokemon` class and call the `getInfo()` method to retrieve information for different Pokémon.
