Sure, here is a condensed and enhanced list of key terms and definitions related to Node.js:

1. **Event Loop**: A design pattern in Node.js that handles asynchronous callbacks, dispatching events or messages.

2. **Callback Function**: A function passed into another function as an argument, invoked to complete a routine or action.

3. **Blocking I/O**: An operation during which execution of Node.js code is paused until a non-JavaScript operation completes, affecting performance.

4. **Non-Blocking I/O**: A method where JavaScript can be processed in the background, improving performance by allowing concurrent operations.

5. **Error-First Callback**: A Node.js convention where callbacks are passed an Error object as the first argument, ensuring errors are handled before successful responses.

6. **Buffer**: A temporary storage spot in Node.js for data being transferred, particularly useful with data streams.

7. **Stream**: A sequence of data processed over time, useful in tasks like reading or writing data to a file.

8. **Event-Driven Programming**: A paradigm in Node.js where the program flow is determined by events like user actions or message passing.

9. **Exception Handling in Node.js**: Errors in Node.js are handled through exceptions. Uncaught exceptions cause the Node.js process to terminate.

10. **Cluster Module**: A module for creating child processes that run simultaneously and share the server port, allowing for efficient utilization of multi-core systems.

11. **Microservices**: An architectural style structuring an application as a collection of maintainable, testable, loosely coupled, independently deployable services.

12. **API Endpoint**: One end of a communication channel in a software interaction.

13. **HTTP Methods**: Request methods indicating the desired action for a given resource (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH).

14. **CRUD Operations**: The four basic operations of persistent storage in web development - Create, Read, Update, Delete.

15. **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: A standard for creating tokens asserting certain claims, used for authentication and information exchange.

16. **MVC Architecture**: A design pattern separating an application into three interconnected components - Model, View, Controller.

17. **Promises**: Objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

18. **Async/Await**: A syntactic sugar built on top of promises, making asynchronous code easier to write and read.

19. **EventEmitter**: A module in Node.js that facilitates communication/interaction between objects based on events.

20. **Middleware**: Functions that have access to the request and response objects, and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.

21. **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: The default package manager for Node.js, used for installing, sharing, and packaging modules.

22. **Modules**: Reusable pieces of code in Node.js that can be exported and imported in other files.

23. **Node.js Core Modules**: Modules like `http`, `url`, `querystring`, `path`, `fs`, etc. that come bundled with Node.js installation.

24. **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used for building web and mobile applications.

25. **Environment Variables**: Dynamic named values that can affect the way running processes will behave on a computer. They can be accessed in Node.js using `process.env`.

26. **REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop)**: An interactive shell that processes Node.js expressions. It reads JavaScript code, evaluates the result of interpreting the line of code, prints the result, and repeats the process.
  
27. **Package.json**: A file in Node.js that usually resides at the root of a package/application and describes the metadata of your project. It includes

1. **Jest**: A JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook, commonly used for testing JavaScript and React applications. It provides features such as a zero-configuration testing experience, mocking, and a great iteration speed.

2. **Test Files**: In Jest, tests are written in files with the `.test.js` extension. These are typically placed in the same folder as the code they are testing, or in a special `__tests__` folder.

3. **Configuration Files**: Jest uses configuration files to understand how to run your tests. These could be a `package.json` file (if you're in a Node.js environment) or a `jest.config.js` file. You don't always need to add anything to these files, but they can be used to configure many aspects of how Jest works.

4. **Writing Tests**: Tests in Jest are written using the `test` function. This function takes a string (which describes what the test is for) and a callback function, where you actually write your test code. Inside this function, you use Jest's `expect` and `toEquals` functions to define what the test should check for.
