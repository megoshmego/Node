The transcript discusses the use of Jest, a JavaScript testing framework, to create unit tests for functions. Key terms and concepts include:

1. **Unit Test**: A type of testing that verifies the correctness of individual units of a program. A unit is the smallest testable part of the software, often a function in an object or module.

2. **Jest**: A JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook. It's used for writing and running tests to verify the functionality of JavaScript code.

3. **Test Case**: In Jest, a test case is defined using the `test` function. Each test case should focus on a particular aspect of the function's behavior.

4. **Expect**: The `expect` function is used in Jest to make assertions about what the expected output of a function should be given certain inputs. 

5. **Matcher**: Matchers are methods in Jest that let you validate different things. For example, `toEqual` is a matcher that checks if a value equals another value.

6. **Describe**: The `describe` function is used in Jest to group related tests. The first argument is a string that describes the group, and the second is a callback function containing the group of tests.

7. **Callback Function**: A function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function.

8. **Function Export/Import**: In JavaScript, functions can be exported from one module and imported into another, allowing for code reuse.

Here's a simple demonstration of the concepts mentioned:

```javascript
// square.js
function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}

function cube(x) {
  return x * x * x;
}

module.exports = { square, cube };

// square.test.js
const { square, cube } = require('./square');

describe('square function', () => {
  test('square should square a positive number', () => {
    const num = square(3);
    expect(num).toEqual(9);
  });

  test('square should square a negative number', () => {
    const num = square(-3);
    expect(num).toEqual(9);
  });
});

describe('cube function', () => {
  test('cube should cube a positive number', () => {
    const num = cube(3);
    expect(num).toEqual(27);
  });
});
```

In this code, we have two functions `square` and `cube` that we want to test. We use Jest's `describe` function to group tests related to the same function. Within each group, we use Jest's `test` function to define individual test cases. Inside the test cases, we use `expect` and a matcher (`toEqual`) to assert that the output of our function matches our expectations.
