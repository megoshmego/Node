1. **Jest**: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook, commonly used for testing JavaScript and React applications. It provides features such as a zero-configuration testing experience, mocking, and a great iteration speed.

2. **Test Files**: In Jest, tests are written in files with the `.test.js` extension. These are typically placed in the same folder as the code they are testing, or in a special `__tests__` folder.

3. **Configuration Files**: Jest uses configuration files to understand how to run your tests. These could be a `package.json` file (if you're in a Node.js environment) or a `jest.config.js` file. You don't always need to add anything to these files, but they can be used to configure many aspects of how Jest works.

4. **Writing Tests**: Tests in Jest are written using the `test` function. This function takes a string (which describes what the test is for) and a callback function, where you actually write your test code. Inside this function, you use Jest's `expect` and `toEquals` functions to define what the test should check for.

5. **Running Tests**: Tests are run using the `jest` command in the terminal. You can run all tests, or specify a particular test file to run.

6. **Module Exports and Requires**: In order to test functions in separate files, you need to use Node.js's `module.exports` to export the function from the file where it's defined, and `require` to import it into the test file.

7. **Callbacks**: A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

Let's demonstrate a simple Jest test setup:

Suppose we have a file `square.js` with a function that squares a number:

```javascript
// square.js
function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}

module.exports = { square };
```

We could write a test for this function in a file called `square.test.js`:

```javascript
// square.test.js
const { square } = require('./square');

test('square should return the square of a number', () => {
  const result = square(3);
  expect(result).toEqual(9);
});
```

Running `jest` in the terminal will execute the test and check if `square(3)` equals `9`. If it does, the test passes; if not, the test fails.
